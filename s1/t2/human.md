Things I noticed should be fixed:

- one request per exchange should be enough to get one or many funding rates
- funding rate should be presented in % per hour
- there should be additional columns showing the raw funding rate and which period is exchange using
- funding time and next funding time should be presented in human format not timestamp
- additional exchange specific output should be on a new column, so data is not lost
- cli file is too long,
