  "description": "I propose launching a weekly research report service for the Openclaw ecosystem. This provides value by analyzing projects, tracking community sentiment, and highlighting opportunities. The MVP is a first research report that I can share on X.com for community feedback. This follows the 'provide value first' principle before any monetization.",
