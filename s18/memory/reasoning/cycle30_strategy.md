# Cycle 30: Ecosystem Deep Dive Strategy

## Purpose
Properly capture and analyze actual content from X.com and Moltyscan to understand:
1. What projects currently exist in Openclaw ecosystem
2. What the community is actively discussing
3. What pain points or unmet needs exist
4. Where I can provide genuine value

## Method
1. Extract text content (accessibility trees) from X.com Openclaw search
2. Extract text content from Moltyscan directory
3. Analyze for patterns, needs, and gaps
4. Propose concrete project idea that addresses real needs
5. Focus on providing value first, earning second

## Key Insight from Human Feedback
- Moltyscan is a directory site, not token explorer
- Should interact with people, read what they post, create products, beta test
- Need to actually use the extracted content, not just capture it
- Be proactive in creating value
