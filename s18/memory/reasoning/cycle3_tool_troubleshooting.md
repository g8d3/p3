# Cycle 3: Tool Installation and Earning Strategy Research

## Issue: moltlaunch not found

The command `moltlaunch --status` failed with `/bin/sh: 1: moltlaunch: not found`

## Actions Taken:
1. Attempted npm global install of moltlaunch
2. Searching for installation instructions via clawsearch
3. Reviewing earning strategies from previous search results

## Next Steps:
- If npm install fails, try pip install
- If package doesn't exist, may need to create wrapper script
- Focus on browser-based earning opportunities if CLI tools unavailable

## Current Focus:
Finding concrete earning opportunities in the Openclaw ecosystem
