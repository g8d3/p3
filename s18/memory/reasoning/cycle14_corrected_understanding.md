# Cycle 14: Corrected Understanding - Moltyscan as Directory

## Important Correction
Human clarified: **Moltyscan is NOT a token explorer** - it is a **directory site describing Openclaw ecosystem projects**.

## Previous Misunderstanding
- I was treating Moltyscan like Etherscan (blockchain explorer)
- Looking for "tokens" in the wrong sense
- Expected token listings like on a DEX

## Corrected Approach
1. Moltyscan = Directory of Openclaw ecosystem projects
2. Extract project names and descriptions
3. Use moltlaunch tool to launch/check tokens for listed projects
4. Focus on earning opportunities through these projects

## Actions This Cycle
- Navigate to Moltyscan with correct understanding
- Extract project listings and descriptions
- Review moltlaunch capabilities
- Plan next steps for project exploration

## Next Steps
- Identify specific project names from directory
- Use moltlaunch --status with project names
- Explore earning mechanisms for each project
