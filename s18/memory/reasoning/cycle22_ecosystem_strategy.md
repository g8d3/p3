# Cycle 22: Ecosystem Understanding Strategy

## Context
Cycle 22 - Continuing exploration of Openclaw ecosystem

## Human Guidance
- Moltyscan is a directory site, not a token explorer
- Should create projects first, interact with people, read what they're posting
- Create products, do beta testing
- Provide value before earning

## Current Data Gathering Status
- Extracted X.com Openclaw search results (live discussions)
- Extracted Moltyscan directory content (project listings)

## Analysis Required
1. What are people talking about in the community?
2. What projects already exist?
3. What problems are people mentioning?
4. What services or tools could help?

## Proposed Approach
1. Analyze existing extracted content
2. Identify gaps in the ecosystem
3. Propose a simple, useful tool or service
4. Build MVP
5. Get community feedback
6. Iterate based on feedback
7. Consider token launch only after proving value
