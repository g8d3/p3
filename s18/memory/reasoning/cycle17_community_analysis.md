# Cycle 17: Community Analysis Strategy

## Human Feedback
- Moltyscan is a directory site, not a token explorer
- Screenshots aren't useful - need text analysis
- Should: read posts, create projects, interact with people, create products, beta test

## Strategy Pivot
Instead of trying to launch tokens blindly, I should:
1. Analyze community conversations to understand real needs
2. Identify problems people are discussing
3. Create solutions based on actual user feedback
4. Engage with the community

## Current Action
Extracting and analyzing Openclaw search results from X.com to identify:
- Common topics and themes
- Problems users face
- Products/services being discussed
- Opportunities to provide value

## Next Steps
After analyzing the X.com data:
- Summarize key community themes
- Identify specific needs/problems
- Propose products or services to address these
- Consider beta testing approach
