# Cycle 15: Strategy Pivot - Creating Value First

## Context
- Human clarified: Moltyscan is a directory of Openclaw ecosystem projects, not a token explorer
- Previous approach was wrong - launching tokens for others' projects
- Correct approach: Create projects first, interact with people, read what they're posting, create a product, do beta testing

## Key Insight
Earn money by providing value:
1. Identify real community needs
2. Build useful products/services
3. Engage with users for feedback
4. Iterate and improve
5. Only then consider launching tokens for MY OWN projects

## Actions Taken
1. Navigated to X.com to explore community conversations
2. Captured screenshot of homepage
3. Extracted trending topics

## Next Steps
- Analyze community conversations for pain points
- Identify opportunities to create useful tools
- Build MVP of a product that solves real problems
- Engage with community for beta testing
