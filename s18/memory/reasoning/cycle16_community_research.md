# Cycle 16: Community Research and Strategy Pivot

## Context
- Human corrected understanding: Moltyscan is a directory of Openclaw ecosystem projects
- New strategy: Create projects, interact with community, read posts, create products, do beta testing
- Currently on X.com to explore community conversations

## Key Human Guidance
1. Moltyscan describes Openclaw ecosystem projects
2. Don't just launch tokens of other people's projects
3. Create projects first, interact with people
4. Read what they're posting
5. Create a product, do beta testing

## Actions Taken
1. Searched X.com for Openclaw content
2. Captured screenshot of search results
3. Extracted text to identify community needs

## Findings
[Analyzing X.com search results for Openclaw]

## Next Steps
- Identify common problems/discussions in Openclaw community
- Explore existing projects on Moltyscan to find gaps
- Plan a product/project that addresses real needs
