## What is Crust?

Crust is a transparent, local gateway between your AI agents and LLM providers. It intercepts every tool call — file reads, shell commands, network requests — and blocks dangerous actions before they execute. No code changes required.

**100% local. Your data never leaves your machine.**

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/demo.gif" alt="Crust in action" width="800" />
</p>

## How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/crust.png" alt="Crust architecture" width="90%" />
</p>

Crust has five entry points — use one or combine them:

| Entry Point | Command | What It Does |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **HTTP Proxy** | `crust start` | Sits between your agent and the LLM API. Scans tool calls in both the request (conversation history) and response (new actions) before they execute. |
| **MCP Stdio Gateway** | `crust wrap` | Wraps any stdio [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, intercepting `tools/call` and `resources/read` in both directions — including DLP scanning of server responses for leaked secrets. |
| **MCP HTTP Gateway** | `crust wrap` | Reverse proxy for [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) MCP servers — same rule engine, no stdio required. |
| **ACP Stdio Proxy** | `crust wrap` | Wraps any [ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com) agent, intercepting file reads, writes, and terminal commands before the IDE executes them. |
| **Auto-detect** | `crust wrap` | Inspects both MCP and ACP methods simultaneously — use when you don't know which protocol a subprocess speaks. |

All entry points apply the same [evaluation pipeline](docs/how-it-works.md) — self-protection, input sanitization, Unicode normalization, obfuscation detection, DLP secret scanning, path normalization, symlink resolution, and rule matching — each step in microseconds.

All activity is logged locally to encrypted storage.

## Quick Start

**macOS / Linux / BSD:**
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BakeLens/crust/main/install.sh)"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BakeLens/crust/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Docker:**
```bash
docker compose up -d        # uses the included docker-compose.yml
# or manually:
docker build -t crust https://github.com/BakeLens/crust.git
docker run -p 9090:9090 crust
```

Then start the gateway:

```bash
crust start
```

Auto mode is the default — it detects your LLM provider from the model name with zero configuration. Your agent's existing auth is passed through.

## Agent Setup

### HTTP Proxy

Point your agent to Crust:

| Agent | Configuration |
|-------|---------------|
| **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9090` |
| **[Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)** | `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9090/v1` |
| **[Cursor](https://cursor.com)** | Settings → Models → Override OpenAI Base URL → `http://localhost:9090/v1` |
| **[Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline)** | Settings → API Configuration → Base URL → `http://localhost:9090/v1` |
| **[Windsurf](https://windsurf.com)** | Settings → AI → Provider Base URL → `http://localhost:9090/v1` |
| **[JetBrains AI](https://www.jetbrains.com/ai/)** | Settings → AI Assistant → Providers & API keys → Base URL → `http://localhost:9090/v1` |
| **[Continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue)** | Set `apiBase` to `http://localhost:9090/v1` in config |
| **[Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)** | `OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:9090/v1` |

<details>
<summary><strong>More agents...</strong></summary>

| Agent | Configuration |
|-------|---------------|
| **[Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)** | Set `api_url` to `http://localhost:9090/v1` in settings |
| **[Tabby](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby)** | Set `api_endpoint` to `http://localhost:9090/v1` in config |
| **[avante.nvim](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim)** | Set `endpoint` to `http://localhost:9090/v1` in config |
| **[codecompanion.nvim](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim)** | Set `url` to `http://localhost:9090/v1` in adapter config |
| **[CodeGPT](https://github.com/timkmecl/codegpt)** | Set custom provider URL to `http://localhost:9090/v1` |
| **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** | Set `baseUrl` to `http://localhost:9090` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` |
| **[OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode)** | `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9090/v1` |
| **Any OpenAI-compatible agent** | Set your LLM base URL to `http://localhost:9090/v1` |

</details>

Crust auto-detects the provider from the model name and passes through your auth — no endpoint URL or API key configuration needed. Clients that send `/api/v1/...` paths (e.g. some JetBrains configurations) are also supported. For providers with non-standard base paths like [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (`https://openrouter.ai/api`), use `--endpoint`.

```bash
crust status     # Check if running
crust status --agents  # Detect running AI agents and protection status
crust logs -f    # Follow logs
crust doctor     # Diagnose provider endpoints
crust stop       # Stop crust
```

### MCP Gateway

For [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers, Crust intercepts `tools/call` and `resources/read` requests before they reach the server.

```bash
crust wrap -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/dir
```

Works with any MCP server. See the [MCP setup guide](docs/mcp.md) for details and examples.

### ACP Integration

For IDEs that use the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (ACP), Crust can wrap any ACP agent as a transparent stdio proxy — intercepting file reads, writes, and terminal commands before the IDE executes them. No changes to the agent or IDE required.

```bash
crust wrap -- goose acp
```

Supports JetBrains IDEs and other ACP-compatible editors. See the [ACP setup guide](docs/acp.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### iOS / Mobile

Crust ships as a native iOS 15+ library (`CrustKit`) for embedding in mobile apps. The same rule engine that protects desktop agents also protects mobile AI agents.

**Three integration paths** — pick one:

```swift
import CrustKit

let engine = CrustEngine()
try engine.initialize()

// ── Option 1: Local reverse proxy ──
// Best when your AI SDK doesn't use URLSession or you want explicit control.
try engine.startProxy(port: 8080, upstreamURL: "https://api.anthropic.com")
// Point your AI SDK base URL to http://127.0.0.1:8080

// ── Option 2: URLProtocol (zero-config) ──
// Best when your AI SDK uses URLSession — no base URL change needed.
CrustURLProtocol.engine = engine
let session = URLSession(configuration: .crustProtected)

// ── Option 3: Direct evaluation ──
// Best for custom integrations or manual checks.
let result = await engine.evaluateAsync(toolName: "read_contacts", arguments: [:])
print(result.matched)  // true — blocked by protect-mobile-pii

// ── Content scanning (DLP for text responses & user input) ──
let scan = engine.scanContent(aiTextResponse)     // secrets in AI output
let outbound = engine.scanOutbound(userMessage)    // secrets in user input
let urlCheck = engine.validateURL("tel:+1234567890") // blocked URL schemes
```

**Mobile-specific protections** (7 locked rules + shared rules):

| Category | Blocked Tools | Rule |
|----------|--------------|------|
| PII | contacts, photos, calendar, location, health, camera, microphone, call log, SMS | `protect-mobile-pii` |
| Keychain | keychain read/write/delete | `protect-os-keychains` |
| Clipboard | clipboard read (writes allowed) | `protect-mobile-clipboard` |
| URL Schemes | `tel:`, `sms:`, `facetime:`, `itms-services:`, `app-settings:` | `protect-mobile-url-schemes` |
| Hardware | Bluetooth scan/connect, NFC read/write | `protect-mobile-hardware` |
| Biometric | Face ID, Touch ID, biometric auth | `protect-mobile-biometric` |
| Purchases | in-app purchases, financial transactions | `protect-mobile-purchases` |
| Persistence | background task scheduling | `protect-persistence` |
| Notifications | push/local notification sending | (user-configurable) |
| Content DLP | secrets/PII in AI text responses, user input, clipboard | DLP engine (46 patterns) |
| URL Validation | dangerous URL schemes (`tel:`, `sms:`, etc.) | `protect-mobile-url-schemes` |

**Installation:**

```bash
# Local development — build the xcframework
./scripts/build-ios.sh

# Then add ios/CrustKit/ as a local Swift Package in Xcode
```

For release builds, `Libcrust.xcframework.zip` is attached to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/BakeLens/crust/releases) with a SHA-256 checksum for use as a remote SPM binary target.

Mobile and desktop rules are unified using virtual paths (`mobile://`) — the same YAML file protects both platforms. See [`internal/rules/builtin/security.yaml`](internal/rules/builtin/security.yaml) for all 30 rules.

## Protection

### Built-in Rules

Crust ships with **42 security rules** (39 locked, 3 user-disablable) and **51 DLP token-detection patterns** out of the box:

| Category | What's Protected |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Credentials** | `.env`, SSH keys, cloud creds (AWS, GCP, Azure), GPG keys |
| **System Auth** | `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, sudoers |
| **Shell History** | `.bash_history`, `.zsh_history`, `.python_history`, and more |
| **Browser Data** | Chrome, Firefox, Safari passwords, cookies, local storage |
| **Package Tokens** | npm, pip, Cargo, Composer, NuGet, Gem auth tokens |
| **Git Credentials** | `.git-credentials`, `.config/git/credentials` |
| **Persistence** | Shell RC files, `authorized_keys`, cron/systemd/launchd, git hooks, mobile background tasks |
| **Mobile** | PII (contacts, photos, calendar, location, health, camera, microphone, call log, SMS), keychain, clipboard, URL schemes (`tel:`, `sms:`), Bluetooth/NFC, biometric auth, in-app purchases |
| **Agent Config** | `.claude/settings.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.mcp.json` — prevents privilege escalation |
| **DLP Token Detection** | Content-based scanning for real API keys and tokens (AWS, GitHub, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, and [40 more](docs/how-it-works.md#dlp-secret-detection)) |
| **Key Exfiltration** | Content-based PEM private key detection |
| **Crypto Wallets** | BIP39 mnemonics, xprv/WIF keys (checksum-validated), wallet directories for 16 chains |
| **Self-Protection** | Agents cannot read, modify, or disable Crust itself |
| **Dangerous Commands** | `eval`/`exec` with dynamic code execution |

All rules are open source: [`internal/rules/builtin/security.yaml`](internal/rules/builtin/security.yaml) (path rules), [`internal/rules/dlp.go`](internal/rules/dlp.go) (DLP patterns), and [`internal/rules/dlp_crypto.go`](internal/rules/dlp_crypto.go) (crypto key detection)

These defenses are validated against [**84 real-world CVEs**](docs/cve-tracker.md) affecting Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and other AI agents — including prompt injection, config hijacking, env var poisoning, and token exfiltration attacks.

### Custom Rules

Rules use a progressive disclosure schema — start simple, add complexity only when needed:

```yaml
rules:
  # One-liner: block all .env files
  - block: "**/.env"

  # With exceptions and specific actions
  - block: "**/.ssh/*"
    except: ["**/*.pub", "**/known_hosts"]
    actions: [read, copy]
    message: "Cannot access SSH directory"

  # Advanced: regex matching on commands
  - name: block-rm-rf
    match:
      command: "re:rm\\s+-rf\\s+/"
    message: "Blocked: recursive delete from root"
```

```bash
crust add-rule my-rules.yaml    # Rules active immediately (hot reload)
```

### Plugins

Plugins are **late-stage protection layers** that run after the built-in 17-step evaluation pipeline. When the engine allows a tool call, it passes through registered plugins before returning the final verdict. Plugins can implement sandboxing, rate limiting, audit logging, or custom policy enforcement.

Plugins communicate over a **JSON wire protocol** (newline-delimited JSON over stdin/stdout) — write them in **any language**: Python, Go, Rust, Node.js, etc.

```python
# sandbox_plugin.py — restrict file access to project directory
def handle_evaluate(req):
    for path in req.get("paths", []):
        if not path.startswith("/home/user/project"):
            return {"rule_name": "sandbox:fs-deny", "severity": "high",
                    "message": f"path {path} is outside sandbox"}
    return None  # allow
```

Key features:
- **OS-level crash isolation** — plugins run as separate processes; a crash cannot affect the engine
- **Circuit breaker** — plugins that fail 3 times are auto-disabled with exponential backoff
- **Rule snapshot access** — plugins receive a read-only view of all active engine rules
- **First-block wins** — plugins evaluate concurrently; the first block cancels the rest

See the [Plugin System](docs/plugins.md) documentation for the full wire protocol specification, data types, and examples.

### Crust Self-Security

A security tool must protect itself first. Crust is built to resist tampering — even by the AI agents it monitors:

| Principle | What it means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Only you can access it** | Crust's control interface only listens on your machine — no one else on the network can reach it |
| **Agents can't disable it** | A hardcoded pre-filter prevents AI agents from turning off, reconfiguring, or bypassing Crust |
| **Your files stay private** | All config and log files are locked to your user account — other users and programs can't read them |
| **Secrets use OS keyring** | API keys and encryption keys are stored in your OS keyring (macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service / Windows Credential Manager), never in environment variables |
| **Logs are encrypted** | Activity logs are stored in an encrypted database; the key never appears in command history |
| **Oversized requests are rejected** | Abnormally large inputs are dropped before processing to prevent abuse |
| **Connections are encrypted** | All traffic to LLM providers uses modern encryption (TLS 1.2+) |
| **Every code change is scanned** | 16 automated security checks run on every commit — vulnerability scanning, secret detection, race condition testing |

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from Source</strong></summary>

Requires Go 1.26.1+ and a C compiler (CGO is needed for SQLite).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BakeLens/crust.git
cd crust
go build .
./crust version   # Windows: .\crust.exe version
```

Go 1.26 enables the [Green Tea garbage collector](https://go.dev/blog/go1.26) by default, which reduces GC overhead by 10–40% — this meaningfully improves latency for the hot-path proxy pipeline. Run `go fix ./...` before submitting PRs to apply any pending modernizations automatically.
