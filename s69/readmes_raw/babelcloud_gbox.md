**GBOX** provides environments for AI Agents to operate computer and mobile devices.

![GBOX Introduction](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eded50bd-4498-4bca-85f8-fb3ec272e032)

*Mobile Scenario:*
Your agents can use GBOX to develop/test android apps, or run apps on the Android to complete various tasks(mobile automation).

*Desktop Scenario:*
Your agents can use GBOX to operate desktop apps such as browser, terminal, VSCode, etc(desktop automation).

*MCP:* 
You can also plug GBOX MCP to any Agent you like, such as Cursor, Claude Code. These agents will instantly get the ability to operate computer and mobile devices.

## Installation

### System Requirements

- MacOS 
  - Version: 10.15 or later
  - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

> Note: Using gbox on other platforms, please check npm package [@gbox.ai/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gbox.ai/cli) for installation instructions. You can also login to [GBOX.AI](https://gbox.ai) to use web-based dashboard.

### Installation Steps

#### Quick Install (Recommended)

**Option 1: Install GBOX CLI only**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babelcloud/gbox/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs just the GBOX CLI. Additional dependencies (like ADB, frpc, Appium) will be automatically installed when needed, or you can install them later using:
```bash
gbox setup
```

**Option 2: Install with all dependencies (one-step setup)**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babelcloud/gbox/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --with-deps
```

This installs everything at once:
- GBOX CLI
- Node.js and npm (if not present)
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB)
- FRP client (frpc)
- Appium server, drivers and plugins

**Non-Interactive Mode:**
```bash
# CLI only
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babelcloud/gbox/main/install.sh | bash -s -- -y

# With all dependencies
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babelcloud/gbox/main/install.sh | bash -s -- -y --with-deps
```

#### Alternative Installation Methods

**Via Homebrew (macOS):**
```bash
brew install gbox
```

**Via npm (Linux/Windows):**
```bash
npm install -g @gbox.ai/cli
```

#### Setup Dependencies

If you installed GBOX CLI only, you can install all command dependencies anytime:
```bash
gbox setup
```

Or install them interactively:
```bash
gbox setup -y
```

#### Update GBOX CLI

Keep your GBOX CLI up to date:

**Using the install script:**
```bash
# Interactive update (will prompt if already installed)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babelcloud/gbox/main/install.sh | bash

# Force update without prompt
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babelcloud/gbox/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --update

# Skip update even if newer version available
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babelcloud/gbox/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --update=false
```

**Using Homebrew (macOS):**
```bash
brew upgrade gbox
```

**Using npm (Linux/Windows):**
```bash
npm update -g @gbox.ai/cli
```

#### Get Started

```bash
# Login to gbox.ai
gbox login

# Connect your Android device (dependencies will be installed automatically if missing)
gbox device-connect

# Export MCP config and merge into Claude Code/Cursor
gbox mcp export --merge-to claude-code
gbox mcp export --merge-to cursor
```

### Command Line Usage

Check [GBOX CLI Reference](https://docs.gbox.ai/cli) for detailed usage.

### SDK Usage

Check [GBOX SDK Reference](https://docs.gbox.ai/sdk) for detailed usage.

## Use GBOX as a MCP Server(Login required)

Using GBOX CLI to configure MCP server to your Claude Code/Cursor:
```bash
# Export MCP config for Cursor
gbox mcp export --merge-to cursor

# Export MCP config for Claude Code
gbox mcp export --merge-to claude-code --scope project

```

Or copy paste the following content into your Claude Code/Cursor MCP config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gbox-android": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@gbox.ai/mcp-server@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
> Note:
> - Currently, GBOX MCP can only control Android environments.
> - If you need Cursor/Claude Code to control your local Android device, please check [Register Local Device](https://docs.gbox.ai/cli/register-local-device)

- Linux Desktop/Browser

### Android Environment
There are three types of Android environments, you can choose based on your needs:

**1. Cloud Virtual Device:** 

Login to [GBOX.AI](https://gbox.ai) to get a cloud virtual device. Best for testing and development.

**2. Cloud Physical Device:** 

Login to [GBOX.AI](https://gbox.ai) to get a cloud physical device. Cloud physical device is a real Android phone that you can use for production scenarios.

**3. Local Physical Device:** 

Use your own physical device [Register Local Device](https://docs.gbox.ai/cli/register-local-device). Your local device can be any Android device that have Developer Mode enabled. Best for production scenarios and personal use.

### Linux Desktop/Browser Environment

Login to [GBOX.AI](https://gbox.ai) to get a Linux desktop/browser environment. Best for testing and development.
