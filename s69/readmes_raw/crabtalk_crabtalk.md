**Agent daemon.** Runs agents, dispatches tools, connects to MCP servers.
Start it, talk to it, extend it with packages.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://crabtalk.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Or `cargo install crabup` and use it to pull the rest. See the [installation guide][install] for details.

## Quick Start

```bash
cargo install crabup         # one-time: install the package manager
crabup pull daemon           # fetch the daemon binary
crabup pull tui              # fetch the TUI client
crabtalkd setup              # one-time interactive LLM endpoint config
crabup daemon start          # install the service unit and start it
crabtalk-tui                 # chat
```

Full config reference: [`crates/crabtalk/config.toml`](crates/crabtalk/config.toml).

## How It Works

The daemon ships with built-in tools (shell, task delegation, memory),
MCP server integration, and skills (Markdown prompt files).

[Apps](apps/) are agent-powered experiences and standalone services
built on top of the daemon — independent binaries that connect via
auto-discovery.
